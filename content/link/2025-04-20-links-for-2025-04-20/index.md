Shorter post this time as I've spent most of this week catching shows from the [Melbourne International Comedy Festival](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/)

- [I don't know what MCP is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask | Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/post/what-is-mcp/) - A quick intro to MCP (Model Context Protocol) with links to learn more
- [LLMs can't stop making up software dependencies and sabotaging everything | The Register](https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2025/04/12/ai_code_suggestions_sabotage_supply_chain/) - Since September LLMs have produced code with made-up package names. This is a security issue as bad actors can hijack the hallucinated package name to distribute malicious code
- [Work friends | everything changes](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/work-friends/) - The friendships you make at work can continue long after you or those friends have left the company, as long as you keep in touch
