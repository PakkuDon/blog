This blog needs more content and I have been trying to make an effort to read more things.

So here's a new series where I share links to stuff I've seen or recommended to other people recently. I haven't figured out what this will look like yet but readers can expect the following:
- A new post either on Sunday or Monday every 1 to many weeks
- Links to things about tech, culture, whatever my current hobbies are, or stuff I found interesting

Enjoy!
