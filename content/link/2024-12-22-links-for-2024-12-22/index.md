- [Get your work recognized: write a brag document | Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) - Was thinking of this as we're almost at the end of another year. Create a doc to capture all your accomplishments so you can remember them and reflect on what you've done. Consider sharing it with your manager and peer reviewers so they can remember what you did too
- [Herzbergâ€™s Two-Factor Theory Of Motivation-Hygiene | Simply Psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/herzbergs-two-factor-theory.html) - Herzberg posits that there are two separate types of factors that affect job satisfaction and dissatisfaction: hygienic and motivational. Dealing only with dissatisfying factors may only placate workers. Motivational factors are key
- [Inversion and The Power of Avoiding Stupidity | fs.blog](https://fs.blog/inversion/) - When faced with a difficult problem don't just think about how you can solve it. Think about how you could worsen or exacerbate a problem and avoid those actions
- [State of JavaScript 2024](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US) - Results for this year's State of JavaScript survey
- [Vanilla Weather](https://vanillaweather.com/) - A weather app with no ads, and no tracking. I'm unsure which weather model / API this uses so YMMV
