There's been more auroras recently as we're either in or approaching the peak of the [solar cycle](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression). I caught my first aurora during the [G5 geomagnetic storm back in May this year](https://media.bom.gov.au/releases/1225/the-bureau-observes-a-g5-geomagnetic-storm/) and I caught a glimpse of another one from my backyard today.

Here's some resources that I've found useful as someone based in inner Victoria:
