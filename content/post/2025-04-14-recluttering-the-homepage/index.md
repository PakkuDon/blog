[Previously](/blog/post/2025/03/17/link-posts-have-moved) I moved all link posts to their own content section so that the homepage of the blog wouldn't be flooded with link posts. This had the unintended side-effect of removing these articles from the archive and search pages as both of those pages only return results from the main sections configured in Hugo

I do want to search from past links I've shared as I may want to share them with other folks because reasons. So link posts are back on the homepage once more. If you want to see posts only you can find those at [/blog/post](/blog/post)

That's all for today. Until next time ðŸ‘‹
