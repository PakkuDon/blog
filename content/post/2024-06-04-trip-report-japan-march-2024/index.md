Mid-late March this year I travelled to Japan with my family. It was my first international trip since covid and also my first time visiting Japan.

I know a few folks travelling there soon who may want ideas for things to do. I also had some photos I wanted to share and nowhere to put them. So I've made this post to address both of those things.

# General notes
- I used [Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/), [/r/JapanTravel](https://old.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/) and [/r/JapanTravelTips](https://old.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/) to find things to do. [Japan.travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/au/) also looks like it may be useful
- The main thing we were hoping to see were the cherry blossoms. We managed to snag a few photos, but colder than average temperatures pushed the peak of the season past our departure date
- We didn't have a particularly detailed itinerary before we arrived. We had a spreadsheet and Google doc with a list of things we wanted to check out, but for the most part we were planning things day by day
- I signed up for [Ubigi](https://www.ubigi.com/)'s 10 GB for 30 days plan as it was recommended by a few folks on [/r/JapanTravel](https://old.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/). I finished the trip with 2.4 GB to spare
- We used [Japan Travel by Navitime](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navitime.inbound.walk&hl=en&gl=US) and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) to find our way around
- We bought a [JR Pass](https://japanrailpass.net/en/) ahead of time. We didn't get much use out of it as we didn't make as many day trips as we thought we would. It did at least get us a discount on the Shinkansen
- We were travelling with someone who couldn't consume too much red meat, too much fried food, or any raw seafood. This narrowed our food options somewhat
- A few days before our flight we enabled international payments on our regular cards so that we could use them to pay or withdraw cash while we were travelling. This was probably costly given all the transaction fees

# Things I would like to revisit or try next time
Not a comprehensive list, but here's a few things on my wishlist:

- Try more food. We didn't get a chance to try Ichiran Ramen or Gyukatsu Motomura. There's also heaps of Michelin star restaurants in Tokyo
- [Nara Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TWkC9rTPwuWJgW4C8) for the deer
- [Dotonbori, Osaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ccFzLoRsryMQNQGA8). We only strolled through two streets during our time here. There's heaps of shops and restaurants to check out
- [Shibuya Sky, Tokyo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xdvMec3kFNCCfjtv7)
- [Shinjuku Gyoen, Tokyo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yW7FoULTiBZHCeCp7) on a sunny day
- [Kiyomizu-dera, Kyoto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5fXVkNChUpBvYk3a6) during sunset or during autumn for a different view
- [Higashiyama District, Kyoto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LH26wj8hwzWx8BmL7). We made a bee-line for Kiyomizu-dera so we skipped most of it, including streets like [Ninenzaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WDheADG9cBBjRtLr8), [Sannenzaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ndec2CpCqUsZszLw5) and [Hanamikoji Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T2FWpmKYWiUPFL1f6)
- [Philosopher's Path, Kyoto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SkNgB85g8DCwjzoB6)
- Visit a ryokan
- See a floating torii gate
- Take part in a tea ceremony - probably somewhere in Kyoto?

Thanks for reading this post! Catch you next time 👋
